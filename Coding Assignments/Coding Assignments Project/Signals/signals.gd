#Signals are a very powerful tool that allows us to communicate between nodes and scripts.
#Nodes have a number of built in Signals, but we can define our own Signals as well

#1: Create a new variable below, give it the default value of 0


#2: Create a new signal below

#3: Connect the signal to the Label

func _process(delta):
	
	#4 Emit our signal below, pass our variable as an argument for the signal
	
	
	
	pass


#5: Connect Timer1's timeout() signal to this node
# Inside of the connected signal's function, increment our variable by 10
