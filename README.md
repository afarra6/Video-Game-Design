# DDEM - Video Game Design


# How to Use this GitHub

This repository includes assignments, demonstrations, projects, and other resources for teaching Intro Video Game Design in the Godot engine. The Godot projects included were created in Godot 4.x and it is recommended to use the newest version of Godot. The resources here can be used as is, or as a jumping off point for creating derivative assignments. The projects are divided into three categories, coding assignments, engine assignments, and integrated assignments.

# Course Overview

This course is constructed with the assumption that it will be divided into 2 parts: 

* First Semester: Introduction to the Godot Engine and Foundational Concepts
    * Introduction to core 2D concepts in Godot
    * Introduction to GDScript
    * Covering Game Design concepts: Aesthetics, Genres, Graphics, and Mechanics
    * Brief overview of 3D concepts
    * Culminates in a collective "micro-game" project
* Second Semester: Large Scale Group Project
    * Introduction of more abstract concepts: Singletons, State Machines
    * Students design and build a large scale (ie. more than 1 screen) game in groups
    * Exposure to advanced tools: Plugins, Particle Effects, Ray Casting, etc.
    * Students deliver an "alpha" version (mid-semester) and a "beta" or "release" version (end of semester)

At the end of this course students will have:

* Gained/refined coding skills using the GDScript language
* Developed leadership/team skills and learned how to work in a group on a complex project
* Created a "Capstone" level project that shows profeciency in a high-level coding language
* A well documented progression through their project, including pseudo-code and early problem solving

While it is expected that students taking this course have previous coding experience, much of the early material covers foundational coding concepts. Every effort is being made to make the class accessible to students of varying coding experience.

# Coding assignments

Coding Assignments require the students to write scripts in the GDScript language but do not require students to create nodes or interface with the engine outside of the IDE. These explore foundational coding concepts including:

* Declaring variables
* Typing variables
* Using if, else, and else-if statements
* Data types
* Creating functions
* etc.

And GDScript specific concepts including:

* The process() function
* The ready() function
* Exporting variables
* Creating signals
* etc.


# Engine assignments

Engine Assignments require the students to create nodes, resources, or other non-scripting resources in the engine. This includes:

* Creating nodes
* Creating and assigning materials
* Organizing files
* Building Scenes
* etc.


# Integrated assignments

This is a catch all category for assignments and projects that require students to script and work in-engine. This includes:

* Large projects
* Signals
* Instancing scenes
* Freeing scenes
* etc*

Certain integrated assignments are only text prompts, such as end of term projects. These categories are not meant to be followed chronologically. Teachers should grab assignments as the topics appear in their curriculum/class progress.


# Future plans and tours

Currently many of the assignments are being migrated over to an in-engine tour format, utilizing GDQuest's godot-tours plugin. These will be able to provide a more guided introduction to concepts in the Godot engine.
