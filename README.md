# DDEM - Video Game Design


# How to Use this GitHub

This repository includes assignments, demonstrations, projects, and other resources for teaching Intro Video Game Design in the Godot engine. The Godot projects included were created in Godot 4.0. The resources here can be used as is, or as a jumping off point for creating derivative assignments. The projects are divided into three categories, coding assignments, engine assignments, and integrated assignments.


# Coding assignments

Coding Assignments require the students to write scripts in the GDScript language but do not require students to create nodes or interface with the engine outside of the IDE. These explore foundational coding concepts including:

* Declaring variables
* Typing variables
* Using if, else, and else-if statements
* Data types
* Creating functions
* etc.

And GDScript specific concepts including:

* The process() function
* The ready() function
* Exporting variables
* Creating signals
* etc.


# Engine assignments

Engine Assignments require the students to create nodes, resources, or other non-scripting resources in the engine. This includes:

* Creating nodes
* Creating and assigning materials
* Organizing files
* Building Scenes
* etc.


# Integrated assignments

This is a catch all category for assignments and projects that require students to script and work in-engine. This includes:

* Large projects
* Signals
* Instancing scenes
* Freeing scenes
* etc*

Certain integrated assignments are only text prompts, such as end of term projects. These categories are not meant to be followed chronologically. Teachers should grab assignments as the topics appear in their curriculum/class progress.
